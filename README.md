# **README for Veggie CNN**
## **VeggieCNN**
## Introduction
This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using PyTorch to classify six different types of vegetables from a curated image dataset. The model architecture includes:
+ **2 Convolutional Layers:** For feature extraction
+ **2 Pooling Layers:** For down-sampling.
+ **2 Fully Connected Linear Layers:** For final classification.
  
The activation function used is ReLU throughout the network.

I created this after watching a 5 hour PyTorch Youtube course and wanted to find a basic way of applying those skills I gained to something possibly useful. 

Feel free to check out the code and dataset **[(link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/a-dataset-for-vegetable-identification/data)**, and let me know your thoughts or suggestions for improvement!
