# **README for Veggie CNN**
## **VeggieCNN**
## Introduction
This is a basic CNN model used to identify vegetables of 6 different types from a curated set of images. **[(Link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/a-dataset-for-vegetable-identification/data)**
I created this after watching a 5 hour PyTorch Youtube course and wanted to find a basic way of applying those skills I gained to something possibly useful.
